    <Description>
      This library features two classes, one for classical chess and another for Chess960, that enable you to play Chess and generate moves in a simple manner.
      
      This new version includes a few patches with overall board use, like bug fixes and adding zobrist hashing to both board classes, as well as correcting the way it handles en-passant and fixing an error with updating the code.
      
      My newest addition is PGN support including PGN inputs and outputs, combined with insufficient material checks and a few other things.
