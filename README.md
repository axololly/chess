# Binary Chess

This is the story of how I made Chess using bitboards. (Maybe I'll have an engine, who knows? :eyes:)

## Note: This repository features C# and Python files jumbled together. This will be fixed eventually.

All the explanations of this project can be found in the `doc` folder where I document all the stages to this project.
